= Streetfighting

Battles rage on the streets between the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, nationalist <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>, communist <span style="color: #8B0000;">Rotfrontk√§mpferbund</span> (<span style="color: #8B0000;">**RFB**</span>), and our own Reichsbanner. In some parts of the country, conditions are nearing civil war levels, as dozens of people are killed each month.

We must do something to protect the workers against these predations.

# - @battle: Test our defense units in battle against the fascists!
- @arm_vb: Increase training and armaments for the Reichsbanner.
- @if_training: Train union members to fight as part of the <span style="color: #c00000;">Iron</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">Front</span>.
- @prussian_police_training: Use the Prussian police to help train the Reichsbanner.
- @peace: Try to avoid all militant confrontations, as much as possible.
- @truce_rfb: Try to make peace with the <span style="color: #8B0000;">RFB</span>.

Many Reichsbanner members are not ready for actual fighting, and thus quit. However, the remainder are toughened as a result. Our confrontations also provide ample recruiting material for the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>.

We have increased training and purchased more armaments for the Reichsbanner.

As part of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span>, we are increasing coordination between the Reichsbanner and the unions, and many union members want to become more involved.

on-arrival: vb_militancy += 0.05; sa_strength += 50; prussian_police_training += 1

The loyal sections of the Prussian police can help train the Reichsbanner.

@peace
on-arrival: vb_militancy -= 0.02; vb_strength -= 50; militarism += 1

By not fighting, the strength of the Reichsbanner atrophies. Pacifists in the party are gaining the upper hand.

@truce_rfb
choose-if: nsdap_relation >= 45
view-if: kpd_truce == 0
unavailable-subtitle: The <span style="color: #700000;">KPD</span> is not interested.
on-arrival: kpd_truce = 1; nsdap_relation += 5; rfb_strength += 50; vb_strength += 50; sa_strength += 50;

We have made at least a temporary truce with the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>, so that our respective paramilitaries will stop fighting.
