= Confronting Antisemitism

Antisemitism has long been a latent feature of German society, but since the beginning of the economic depression, it has grown to a horrifying extent. The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are the worst of it, but all the right-wing parties are deeply antisemitic. Regarding the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> specifically, our right-wing enemies love to deploy their racist rhetoric against our many <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jewish</span> comrades, magnifying criticism of any minor transgression, and they call the entire <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> a <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jewish</span> party. We are a favorite target of their invectives.

- @socialism_of_fools: Antisemitism is the "<span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span> of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fools</span>". We will defeat them with real <span style="color: #c00000;">socialism</span>.
- @if: Antisemitism is a crisis. Direct the full force of the <span style="color: #c00000;">Iron</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">Front</span> against antisemitism.
- @all: All Germans will suffer from <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascism</span>, not just the <span style="color: #005EB8;">Jews</span>. We do not need a separate policy for them.

@socialism_of_fools

The best policy to deal with this sort of irrational, senseless hatred is to ignore it. Few are swayed by racist rhetoric; the best way to combat it is to provide economic security so that people do not turn to antisemitism.

We develop an entire campaign against antisemitism under the auspices of the <span style="color: #c00000;">**Iron**</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">**Front**</span>. Hopefully our campaign can sway the workers away from <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazism</span>.

@all

We do not need any special treatment for minorities.
