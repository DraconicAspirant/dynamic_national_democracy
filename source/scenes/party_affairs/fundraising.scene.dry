= Fundraising

For better or for worse, the party cannot exist without money. Without the support of wealthy industrialists, we depend on membership dues to sustain our efforts.

- @maintain: Maintain our current dues.
- @reduce: Reduce dues.
- @increase: Increase dues.

@maintain
subtitle: [+ dues +] resources gained.
on-arrival: resources += dues; resources += 1 if dissent_percent < 5; resources -= 1 if dissent_percent > 30

We maintain our current dues. [? if dissent_percent < 5: Our low party dissent gains us more resources. ?][? if dissent_percent > 30: Our high party dissent loses us resources. ?]

@reduce
subtitle: [+ dues - 1 +] resources gained.
choose-if: dues > 1
on-arrival: dues -= 1; resources += dues; right_dissent -= 8; agrarian_dissent -= 8; christiansocial_dissent -= 8; youngconservative_dissent -= 8; resources += 1 if dissent_percent < 5; resources -= 1 if dissent_percent > 30

Our current members appreciate this, but no one decides to join a party because of the low dues. [? if dissent_percent < 5: Our low party dissent gains us more resources. ?][? if dissent_percent > 30: Our high party dissent loses us resources. ?]

@increase
subtitle: [+ dues + 1 +] resources gained. [? if unemployed >= 15 : Given the present economic situation, this may be painful. ?][? if dues >= 4 : Dues are already rather high; increasing them might reduce our membership. ?]
on-arrival: dues += 1; resources += dues; workers_uspd -= 3; unemployed_uspd -= 3; workers_uspd -= 10 if unemployed >= 15; unemployed_uspd -= 10 if unemployed >= 15; workers_uspd -= 3*dues if dues >= 5; unemployed_uspd -= 3*dues if dues >= 5; resources += 1 if dissent_percent < 5; resources -= 1 if dissent_percent > 30
view-if: dues <= 4

Our members grumble at this, and some of the less committed members leave. But now, we have access to additional resources. [? if dissent_percent < 5: Our low party dissent gains us more resources. ?][? if dissent_percent > 30: Our high party dissent loses us resources. ?]

[? if unemployed >= 15 : Because of the presently high unemployment, our members are feeling the extra burden hard. ?]
