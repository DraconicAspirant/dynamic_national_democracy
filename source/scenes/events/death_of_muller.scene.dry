- @wels_chancellor: Otto Wels (<span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>) for Chancellor.
- @breitscheid_chancellor: Rudolf Breitscheid (<span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>) for Chancellor.
- @bruning_chancellor: Let Heinrich Bruning of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> become Chancellor.
- @wirth_chancellor: Joseph Wirth of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> should be Chancellor.
