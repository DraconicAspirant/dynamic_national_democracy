@vonc_no
title: Support the rump <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>-led government, voting in favor of the government.
subtitle: We would essentially provide "toleration" to a bourgeois government.

By supporting the government, we have essentially entered into a "toleration" arrangement with the [+ chancellor +] government. We do not have a voice in the government, but we are responsible for its continued stability. The left of our party opposes this plan, and would rather that we hold new elections.

@no_matter
title: It does not matter what we do.
subtitle: The anti-government parties have over 50% of the vote, no matter our choices.

on-arrival: prussia_coalition_trigger = 1

The Prussian coalition isn't able to survive either, pressure from the national conservatives within the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> forces them to exit from the <span style="color: #000000;">bourgeois</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> coalition there as well.

- @prussian_coalition_formation: Negotiate a new Prussian coalition.
