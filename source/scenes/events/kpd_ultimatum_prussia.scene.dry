= <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> Goals

At the start of this government, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> presented a list of goals for the Prussian coalition:

[? if interior_goal_seen_prussia = 1 : - Ban the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> and <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span>. - [? if interior_goal_prussia <= 0 : success ?][? if interior_goal_prussia >= 1: failed ?] ?]

[? if rfb_goal_seen_prussia = 1 : - Unban the <span style="color: #700000;">**RFB**</span>. - [? if rfb_goal_prussia <= 0: success ?][? if rfb_goal_prussia >= 1: failed ?] ?]

[? if bureaucracy_goal_seen_prussia = 1 : - Purge the bureaucracy. - [? if bureaucracy_goal_prussia <= 0: success ?][? if bureaucracy_goal_prussia >= 1: failed ?] ?]

[? if free_kpd_goal_seen_prussia = 1 : - Protect <span style="color: #700000;">communist</span> demonstrations. - [? if free_kpd_goal_prussia <= 0: success ?][? if free_kpd_goal_prussia >= 1: failed ?] ?]

@goals_failed
on-arrival: nsdap_relation -= 8; workers_uspd -= 4; unemployed_uspd -= 4; workers_spd += 4; rfb_strength += 100; rfb_militancy += 0.05; in_national_front_prussia = 0; in_harzburg_coalition_prussia = 0; prussia_leader = "Braun"; nsdap_coalition_dissent += 2

Unfortunately, we have failed to accomplish all of the goals the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> set out. They plan to call a vote of no confidence against our government, and have already begun mounting a propaganda campaign to delegitimize our government in the eyes of the workers.

- @new_elections: New elections will be called.
- @skibidi: Could we form a new government based on the <span style="color: #000000;">Center Party</span> and [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**[+ ddp_name +]**</span> (and possibly <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>)?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?]?

@goals_success
on-arrival: workers_uspd += 4; unemployed_uspd += 4; nsdap_relation += 6; workers_spd += 4; kpd_coalition_success += 1; rfb_strength += 150; rfb_militancy += 0.1; reichsexekution += 1

As expected, we have completed the goals set by the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>. [? if president == "Hindenburg": However, over the past few months, President Hindenburg's concerns over our coalition government have grown... ?]
