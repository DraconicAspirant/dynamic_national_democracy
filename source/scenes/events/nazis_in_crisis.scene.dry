= <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> in Crisis

Finally, the internal contradictions of the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> have caught up to it. With the improving economic conditions, many business leaders are less interested in supporting them. Tensions between their remaining big capitalist funders and their lower middle class frontliners have come to a head, leading to desertions and public spats. This all saps Hitler's aura of strength, weakening <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> support across a variety of demographics.

- @celebrate: This is an occasion to celebrate.
- @complacency: The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are still a threat. We must not be too complacent.

@celebrate

This is an occasion to celebrate! Hopefully he <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> will no longer be a threat to the Republic.


@complacency

Even in their weakened state, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> are still a threat. We must not be too complacent.
