= March on Berlin

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span> <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> is mobilizing. Paramilitary forces of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>, organized under the Harzburg Front, have marched on Berlin, threatening to violently overthrow the government.

They demand either immediate elections under the "supervision" of the nationalist paramilitaries, or else the immediate resignation of the government and the appointment of Adolf Hitler as chancellor[? if hitler_deported : , and the revocation of his deportation ?]. It is obvious that they are threatening a civil war if their demands are not met.

@non_govt_menu

It appears that President [+ president +] is looking favorably upon the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascist</span> proposals. Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has announced plans to resign.

After the resignation of the chancellor, Hitler has been appointed chancellor[? if hitler_deported: , after being made a citizen again ?].

@fight_2_pre_civil_war

Our forces confront the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> on the streets of Berlin, and armed fighting erupts. Neither side is dislodged from their positions.

- @civil_war: It is a civil war.

@new_elections_braun_reject

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> reject our offer of free and fair elections. They are demanding that President [+ president +] dismisses the current government and appoints Hitler chancellor. [? if far_right_coalition >= 50 : They claim that since the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> coalition has the majority in the Reichstag, they are constitutionally justified in appointing the chancellor.

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> seem to believe that they would win an election if one were to be held now, so they agree to our holding an election for next month.

go-to: new_elections_2

With the mediation of various establishment figures, new elections are called for next month, without the use of <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> "electoral monitors".

@new_elections_hindenburg_reject

Influenced by his inner circle and by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">fascists</span> in the streets, President Hindenburg rejects our offer of new free and fair elections, and again demands that we resign. There is no arguing.
