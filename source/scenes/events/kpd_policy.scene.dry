# disable this event for now - the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is abstentionist in government. This position is loosely based on Paul Levi's ideas during the Kapp Putsch. A <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> that is willing to support an SPD government would necessarily have some different policy ideas from the Thälmann Stalinist line, so I looked to the earlier Paul Levi <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> as well as the French popular front for ideas.

# ironically the hypothetical <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> position towards the Popular Front is basically analogous to the SPD position towards the Brüning government (i.e. toleration).

@labor
title: Labor Ministry
subtitle: The Labor Ministry is giving significant concessions to organized labor.
view-if: labor_minister_party = "KPD"

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>-controlled Labor Ministry is taking a policy of supporting labor in every dispute between workers and employees, leading to a proliferation of strikes across the country. Given the economic circumstances, there are worries that this could harm any potential economic recovery, not to mention the conflicts this may engender with the bourgeois parties.

Do we support their radical labor policy?

- @labor_support: Of course we support labor.
- @labor_oppose: No, this is too radical.

The pro-labor policy is popular among workers and is bringing the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> more support, but in response businesses are laying off more workers and reducing hours. This is setting the government up for a confrontation with the capitalists.

@labor_oppose
on-arrival: nsdap_coalition_dissent += 1; workers_uspd -= 5; workers_spd += 5; nsdap_relation -= 6

We oppose the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>'s policy, and prevent it from being enacted. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> is displeased, as are the workers who would have stood to benefit.

@economy
title: Economy Ministry
subtitle: The Economy Ministry is pursuing a policy of nationalizations.
view-if: economic_minister_party = "KPD"

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>-controlled Economy Ministry is planning a policy of mass nationalizations. [? if budget < 3 : They plan to use deficit spending to finance state takeovers of underutilized industrial enterprises, and run them for the benefit of the workers. ?] [? if budget >= 3 : They plan to buy out closed and underutilized industrial enterprises, and run them at full capacity for the benefit of the workers. ?] 

Do we support this policy?

- @economy_support: Yes, support the nationalization policy.
- @economy_oppose: No, this must be stopped.

@economy_support
on-arrival: privatization_progress += 1; general_strike_progress += 4; unemployed -= 2.5 if unemployed >= 6; unemployed -= 1.2 if works_councils >= 3; budget -= 3; works_program += 1; workers_uspd += 4*(1-dissent); workers_spd += 8*(1-dissent); unemployed_spd += 4*(1-dissent); coalition_dissent += 2; uspd_relation -= 6; lvp_relation -= 6; z_relation -= 4; new_middle_uspd -= 3; old_middle_uspd -= 3; economy_goal_completed += 1; kpd_influence += 2

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> has gained credit with the workers for enabling many to keep their jobs. Meanwhile, the bourgeois parties and middle-class voters blame the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> for enabling the nationalizations.

@economy_oppose
on-arrival: nsdap_coalition_dissent += 1; workers_uspd -= 5; workers_spd += 5; nsdap_relation -= 6

After opposing the nationalization policy, the <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> has commenced a propaganda campaign against us, accusing the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> of yet another perfidy.

@finance
title: Finance Ministry
subtitle: The Finance Ministry is increasing taxes on the rich.
view-if: finance_minister_party = "KPD"

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>-controlled Finance Ministry

- @finance_support: Yes, we support increasing taxes on the rich.
- @finance_oppose: No, now is not the right time.

@foreign
title: Foreign Ministry
subtitle: The Foreign Ministry is aiding the <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span>.
view-if: foreign_minister_party = "KPD"

The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span>-controlled Foreign Ministry is planning to send economic aid to the <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span>.

- @foreign_support: Yes, we support aiding the <span style="color: #750e0e;">Soviet Union</span>.
- @foreign_oppose: No, this must be stopped.

@interior
title: Interior Ministry
subtitle: The Interior Ministry is engaged in a purge of the security services.
view-if: interior_minister_party = "KPD"

- @interior_support: Yes, we support purging the security services.
- @interior_oppose: No, this seems to be a pretext for a <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> power grab.
