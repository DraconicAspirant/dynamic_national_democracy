= The Harzburg Front

The <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> parties and paramilitaries - the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**NSDAP**</span> (and its paramilitary the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span>), the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> paramilitary group, and the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> - have united to form the Harzburg Front, as a force dedicated to the overthrow of the current government. 

[? if dvp_leader == "Dingeldey": The <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> has worryingly some sympathies towards the national opposition, with some members even attending or sending congratulatory telegrams. ?] 

- @strategy: We must develop a coherent strategy to combat the Right.
- @confronting_nazis.iron_front: We must form the <span style="color: #c00000;">Iron</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">Front</span>!
- @iron_front: The <span style="color: #c00000;">Iron</span> <span style="color: #1A1A1A;">Front</span> will be our answer!

We do not yet have a coherent strategy for combatting the fascists. We must develop one as soon as possible.
