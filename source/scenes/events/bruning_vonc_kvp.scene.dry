= Vote of no confidence

Following the collapse of the Grand coalition, President Hindenburg has appointed Heinrich Brüning of the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span> Party in a government supported by bourgeois forces. However, they cannot survive without the support from us or Hugenberg's <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span>.

Brüning, has reorganized his cabinet to include the parties to the right of the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?], such as the new <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span>, which has been granted generous cabinet positions. We are left with the choice to "tolerate" the government to prevent the gains of extremists within the Reichstag or vote to oust Brüning for new elections.

We have broken with the [+ chancellor +] government, and have voted against them in a vote of no confidence. We also repealed their emergency powers.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].

We try to convince the workers that this policy is necessary in order to maintain a stable parliamentary government, and to deal with the fiscal consequences of the depression. Still, this policy provides excellent recruiting fodder for <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazis</span> and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>. 

The <span style="color: #0087DC;">**KVP**</span> bolster their credentials against Hugenberg's "all or nothing" policy.
