= Cabinet Reshuffled

@menu

Chancellor [+ chancellor +] has announced his intentions to President [+ president +] to reshuffle the cabinet, sacking and replacing all current <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span> ministers and replacing them with bourgeois ones.

By transferring resources to our coalition partners, we can reduce their dissent against our policies. This is a crude, but effective solution.
