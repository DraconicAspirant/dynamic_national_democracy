@left_unity
title: Left-Center Unity
subtitle: Encourage cooperation between the left and center wings of the party.
choose-if: advisor_action_timer = 0
unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?]
on-arrival: advisor_action_timer = 6; right_dissent -= 10; youngconservative_dissent -= 5; agrarian_dissent -= 10; christiansocial_dissent -= 10; paramilitary_dissent -= 5

We have reduced dissent among the party's factions.

@organizing_women

choose-if: advisor_action_timer = 0
unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?]
on-arrival: womens_lefts += 1; workers_uspd += 3*(1-dissent); new_middle_uspd += 5*(1-dissent); advisor_action_timer = 6

Sender's message is popular among young women working in the service sector, and we have recruited many white-collar employees.

[? if uspd_r < 50 : Unfortunately, women still disproportionately support the bourgeois parties. ?]

@against_toleration
title: Against toleration
view-if: not constructive_vonc
subtitle: Break our current toleration arrangement, and bring down the government via a no-confidence vote.
unavailable-subtitle: [? if advisor_action_timer > 0 : [+ advisor_action_timer +] months before next advisor action. ?] [? if dnvp_toleration == 0 : The <span style="color: #c00000;">SPD</span> is not currently in toleration. ?]
choose-if: advisor_action_timer == 0 and dnvp_toleration

We have grown tired of the burdens of toleration, and have called a vote of no confidence in the current minority government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
