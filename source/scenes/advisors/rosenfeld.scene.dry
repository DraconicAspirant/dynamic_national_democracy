We have increased the strength of the left faction with the <span style="color: #c00000;">**SPD**</span>.

Through his work, Rosenfeld has defended individual <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> members; this should make some connections possible.

title: Against toleration
view-if: not constructive_vonc

We have grown tired of the burdens of toleration, and have called a vote of no confidence in the current minority government.

New elections have been set for [+ next_election_month : month +] [+ next_election_year +].
