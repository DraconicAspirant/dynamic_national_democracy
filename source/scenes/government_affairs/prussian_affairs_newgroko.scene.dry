= Prussian Affairs

Prussia, by far the largest and most important state in Germany, is governed by our party, in a coalition with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, [? if ddp_name == "DDP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP" and not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**Liberal People's**</span>?], [? if not lvp_formed:<span style="color: #C0A054;">**People's**</span> parties, along with?][? if lvp_formed:and?] a plethora of minor parties. It is a democratic state government in Germany, led by [? if prussia_leader == "Braun": the able Otto Braun?][? if prussia_leader == "Stegerwald": Adam Stegerwald?][? if prussia_leader == "Brüning": Heinrich Brüning?][? if prussia_leader == "Luther": Hans Luther?].

We can enact policies in Prussia. The inclusion of [? if not lvp_formed: the <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span> and?] the obstructionists in the bourgeois parties will mitigate our effect.

on-arrival: prussian_police_loyalty += 0.06

The police have historically been overrun with <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>, and we are trying to change this, little by little. We have improved the training and recruitment process to select for a broader demographic than the traditional <span style="color: #3E88B3;">conservatives</span>, and to put a tighter leash on their political activity. In addition, we set up committees to investigate the ranks of the police and remove those with <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> sympathies. It is a slow and arduous work.

The right-wing of our coalition is actively sabotaging our efforts of reform.

Current police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +].

@police_strength
on-arrival: prussian_police_strength += 10

We have increased the size of the Prussian police.

The bureaucracy is deeply <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span>, and many abuse their power to favor the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">political right</span>. By removing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">pro-monarchy</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">pro-dictatorship</span> elements, we can democratize it. Some of our opponents claim that we are infringing on individual freedoms, but perhaps the security of the republic requires it.

The [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: right <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] and other right-wing parties are filling the bureaucracy with their own authoritarian and industrialist sympathizers.

As it turns out, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has many allies in the police and bureaucracy, such as in the [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: right <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?]. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if prussian_police_loyalty >= 0.75 : Nevertheless, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is substantially weakened by our ban. ?] 

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. We have disrupted some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

Our coalition partners have called a vote of no confidence and new Prussian landtag elections have been set for [+ next_election_month_prussia : month +] [+ next_election_year_prussia +].

@unban_sh
view-if: sh_banned = 1
on-arrival: sh_banned = 0; sh_strength += 100; coup_progress += 2 if sh_coup_progress >= 6; braun_angry -= 5

The ban is enthusiastically carried out by the police, perhaps too enthusiastically. The <span style="color: #700000;">Communists</span> take this as one more reason why the <span style="color: #c00000;">Socialists</span> are traitors to the <span style="color: #9B0000;">left</span>. However, the <span style="color: #000000;">moderate</span> and <span style="color: #C0A054;">center-right</span> parties approve, as do the police.

We have signed a Concordat between the Free State of Prussia and the Roman Catholic Church, guaranteeing religious freedom for Catholics in Prussia. This sets the stage for the negotiation of a national Concordat covering all of Germany.

[? if dnvp_ideology == "Radical": The Catholic members of the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**DNVP**</span> in Prussia are in open conflict with their leadership over the vote, with many leaving the party. ?] The [? if not lvp_formed: <span style="color: #C0A054;">**DVP**</span>?][? if lvp_formed: <span style="color: #FFCC00;">**LVP**</span>?] and Protestant parties has gotten into disagreements with the <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>.
