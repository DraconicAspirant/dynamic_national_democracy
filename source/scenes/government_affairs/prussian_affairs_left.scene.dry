#subtitle: The state government of Prussia is a bulwark of democracy...

= Prussian Affairs

Prussia, by far the largest and most important state in Germany, is governed by our party, in a coalition with the [? if in_national_front_prussia: <span style="color: #000000;">Center</span>, [? if ddp_in_national_front_prussia and not lvp_formed: [? if ddp_name == "DDP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**Democratic**</span>?][? if ddp_name == "DStP": <span style="color: #D3C24D;">**State**</span>?]?] and <span style="color: #700000;">**Communist**</span> parties.?][? if in_harzburg_coalition_prussia: <span style="color: #700000;">**Communists**</span>.?] It is the most left-wing state government in Germany, led by Kurt Rosenfeld.

We can enact policies in Prussia. [? if president == "Hindenburg": However, President Hindenburg and the political right are closely monitoring our every move and can invoke Reichsexekution at any time. Tread lightly. ?]

The police have historically been overrun with <span style="color: #808080;">reactionaries</span>, and we are trying to change this, little by little. We have improved the training and recruitment process to select for a broader demographic than the traditional <span style="color: #3E88B3;">conservatives</span>, and to put a tighter leash on their political activity. In addition, we set up committees to investigate the ranks of the police and remove those with <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> sympathies. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> have also began to infiltrate some of their own into the police force...

Current police loyalty: [+ prussian_police_loyalty : loyalty +].

@police_strength
on-arrival: prussian_police_strength += 30; rfb_strength += 50

We have increased the size of the Prussian police.

@bureaucracy
on-arrival: prussian_police_loyalty += 0.08; nationalism -= 5; militarism += 1; authoritarianism += 2; anti_democracy += 3*(1-dissent); new_middle_uspd += 2*(1-dissent) if authoritarianism >= 3; new_middle_uspd += 2*(1-dissent) if authoritarianism >= 4; coup_progress += 0.5; dvp_left += 2; ddp_left += 1; lvp_left += 1.5; reichsexekution += 1; bureaucracy_goal_prussia -= 1; new_middle_spd += 2

The bureaucracy is deeply <span style="color: #808080;">reactionary</span>, and many abuse their power to favor the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">political right</span>. By removing the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">pro-monarchy</span> and <span style="color: #7A3C00;">pro-dictatorship</span> elements, we can democratize it. The <span style="color: #700000;">**KPD**</span> have also began to infiltrate some of their own into the state bureaucracy...

As it turns out, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">Nazi</span> <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> has many allies in the police and bureaucracy. Our relationship with the police weakens, and the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> can still organize illegally, right under the police's noses. [? if prussian_police_loyalty >= 0.7 : Nevertheless, the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">**SA**</span> is substantially weakened by our ban. ?] 

[? if coup_progress >= 6: There are reports of an imminent coup by the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>. We have disrupted some of these plans, but the threat is still present. ?]

[? if president == "Hindenburg": Banning the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> weakens our relationship with President Hindenburg, as well as the political <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and the police. ?][? if president != "Hindenburg": Banning the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> weakens our relationship with the political <span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span> and the police. ?] [? if dnvp_in_government = 1 and in_grand_coalition = 1 and president = "Hindenburg" : It also weakens our coalition due to the influence of Hindenburg on the <span style="color: #C0A054;">right</span> wing of our coalition. ?] In addition, the <span style="color: #3E88B3;">**Stahlhelm**</span> still operates out of public sight.

Restrictions are lifted and police are deployed to protect <span style="color: #700000;">Communist</span> demonstrations and organizations from the <span style="color: #7A3C00;">far</span>-<span style="color: #3E88B3;">right</span>.
